# Budget Tracker

This is a simple command-line budget tracking program I built using Python. It allows users to add income and expense records, categorize them, and calculate totals. All data is saved in a CSV file for later use.

## Features

- Add income or expense entries
- Categorize each transaction (e.g., Food, Transport, Salary)
- Automatically calculate and display balance
- Store records in a local CSV file (`data.csv`)
- Avoids duplicate CSV headers if the file already exists

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository:
  
2. Run the script using Python:

3. Follow the on-screen prompts:

4. Your data will be saved in `data.csv` in the same directory.

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- CSV module
- Basic file I/O and input validation
- (Optional for later) matplotlib or pandas for visualization

## What I Learned

- How to work with CSV files using Python
- Writing reusable functions for user input and file handling
- Simple error handling and basic input validation
- Structuring a CLI application from scratch

## Possible Improvements

- Add data visualization (e.g., pie charts for category spending)
- Add ability to edit or delete transactions
- Build a simple GUI with Tkinter or a web version using Flask
- Support for multiple users with login system

## About Me

I'm a high school student from Kazakhstan preparing for a Computer Science degree. I created this project to learn how to build practical tools with Python and understand how data can be stored and processed. I'm continuing to improve it and open to suggestions.
